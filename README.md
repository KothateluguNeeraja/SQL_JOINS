# SQL_JOINS
This project is about using **SQL joins** with tables like 'Students', 'Courses', and 'Enrollments'. 
TABLES 
**Students** – Student details (name, mobile number, department)
- **Courses** – Course details (name, fee, duration)
- **Enrollments** – Which student joined which course
- **merge_table** – Combined data of students + courses + enrollments
  
SQL Joins Used

- `INNER JOIN`
- `LEFT JOIN`
- `RIGHT JOIN`
- `FULL OUTER JOIN` (using `UNION` in MySQL)

WHAT I LEARNED?
-Creating tables and inserting data
- Using different JOINs to connect tables
- Making one combined table using `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`
- Drawing ER Diagram in MySQL Workbench
